# Backend (Alexa)

This folder contains the Lambda functions for Playing the Market.

Alexa:
- Create Lambda handlers here.
- Each Lambda should be in its own file, e.g.:
  - submitPrediction.js
  - getDailyStock.js
  - compareWithModel.js

Cloud Deployment:
- Amanda will update the CloudFormation template to package/deploy these functions.
- When you add new code here, tell Amanda so the deployment template can reference it.
